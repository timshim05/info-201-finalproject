It should



# contain one figure that you have computed and created from data.




# tell who is the target audience of your story


The target audience for our story varies on how you would take this information. From a community citizen, people that are living in areas with high reported crime/police violence can have a better understanding on the correlation/aspect that either contribute or influence it in their neighboorhood.

Taking this information with change, police departments/law enforement agencies can take our relation between police training and knowledge with abuse of police power --> police violence. They can take this data to see what they can change in their systems to help decrease police violence

This information is basically useful for the general public. We all get to be informed on issues relating to police violence and seeing the correlation of people and their actions that lead to police violence. This knowledge can help create a more informed safe community in the United States.
